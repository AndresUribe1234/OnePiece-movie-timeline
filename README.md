# OnePiece-movie-timeline
The purpose of this project was to use html,css, and js to make a dynamic webpage where the user can see the one piece films released since 2009 in a  dynamic way.

This project worked as a way to deepen event creation knowledge in js, html object creation with js and in general how to turn a static webpage into a fun dynamic one!
