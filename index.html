          East Blue in crisis? The news hits the Straw Hat Pirates along their
          journey. With their hometowns facing a pinch, Luffy and his friends
          put their adventures on hold and decide to head back to East Blue,
          when suddenly a mysterious flying pirate ship appears out of the sky.
          The man heading that ship is none other than the infamous Devil Fruit
          user, Golden Lion Shiki, the same legendary pirate who managed to
          escape the great undersea prison Impel Down and stood among such
          infamous pirates as the "Pirate King" Gol D. Roger and Whitebeard.
          After abducting Nami for her intuitive navigational skills, Shiki
          sends Luffy and his crew hurdling down to his own personal floating
          islands. Separated, the crew finds themselves placed in a battle of
          survival with terrifying beasts in mysterious surroundings.

          The entire Straw Hat crew began to search for Luffy's important straw
          hat after he wakes up to find it missing. Meanwhile, while exploring a
          ship that seemed to be empty, Usopp and Chopper happened to find a
          pirate who was sick and decided to treat him back on the Thousand
          Sunny. When a bird was spotted holding onto Luffy's hat, the crew
          began to give chase and have to overcome obstacles such as the
          unexpected Marines and Sea Kings.

          Said to be comparable to the Ancient Weapons, the Marines' trump card
          the "Dyna Stones" have suddenly been stolen and the terrifyingly
          powerful man responsible, former Marine Admiral "Z", stands in the
          path of the Straw Hat Pirates. The Marine Headquarters finally moves
          forward to deal with the conspiracy that threatens to shake the very
          pillars of the New World, and Kuzan encounters the Straw Hat Pirates
          in the New World. Finally, Luffy and his crew move to take a stand
          against Z and his incredible power.
