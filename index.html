        East Blue in crisis? The news hits the Straw Hat Pirates along their
        journey. With their hometowns facing a pinch, Luffy and his friends put
        their adventures on hold and decide to head back to East Blue, when
        suddenly a mysterious flying pirate ship appears out of the sky. The man
        heading that ship is none other than the infamous Devil Fruit user,
        Golden Lion Shiki, the same legendary pirate who managed to escape the
        great undersea prison Impel Down and stood among such infamous pirates
        as the "Pirate King" Gol D. Roger and Whitebeard. After abducting Nami
        for her intuitive navigational skills, Shiki sends Luffy and his crew
        hurdling down to his own personal floating islands. Separated, the crew
        finds themselves placed in a battle of survival with terrifying beasts
        in mysterious surroundings.
